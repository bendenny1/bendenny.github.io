			<h1>Management at Scale</h1>
<h2>Why did we develop this program?</h2>

<p>As companies get bigger, they get slower. This experience is so common it’s almost a law. A start-up is founded and begins its journey enjoying every advantage of seed stage speed, then loses that quickness piecemeal over time. Sub-par managers get hired, sub-optimal policies accumulate and months or years down the road the founders find themselves possessors of a company that completes its goals at a snail’s pace, if at all.</p>
<p>Is it possible to keep that seed-stage speed? The natural inclination of big organizations (and big objects in general, really) is towards slowness, but is there a way to resist that pull, stay fast, serve your costumes within the timelines they need, and stay ahead of the copy-cat companies who are trying to eat off your plate?
</p>
<p>There is, and we know because we have done it. As it turns out, the trick is thinking hard; not just having meetings and talking, but demanding real thinking at every single juncture. It’s examining every single change your organization makes and optimizing for speed. It’s revisiting old policies and making them justify themselves today instead of just letting them ride because it’s less trouble.
</p>
			<p>Internally, we call this <i>Management at Scale</i>. It’s not a website or a book. It’s the philosophy we use to drive everything about how we approach management, and it’s something we can talk about in a dozen ways, whether that’s wide-angle shots of the entire concept or granular drill-down examinations of a single aspect.
</p>
<p>Here are some short summaries of how we apply this concept to different areas of our work. These are just snippets - they are meant to let you see how it applies to some but not all of the aspects of our company <i>Management at Scale</i> affects so you can get a sense of how we talk about these things and how we’d talk about them with you or to your audience.
</p>
<p> Let us know if you’d like to learn more about any particular section; this is far from everything. There’s no entry here we don’t have two hours of stories about; if you’ve got the time to hear them, we have the time to tell them.
</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Hiring</h4>

<p>Seed-stage companies spend an enormous amount of effort on every hire. As they grow bigger, they stop spending as much effort; these hires were once completely handled by the founders or director-level staff, but that doesn’t scale and oversight often falters as a result. As they spend less time, each hire has a larger and larger chance of not being a good fit. We all accept that this is the case, so the obvious question is: Why stop?
</p>

<h4>Interview Case Studies</h4>

<p>None of our hiring managers is allowed to use a case study they haven’t completed themselves. Why? There’s a couple of reasons. First, we’ve found that putting yourself through a process often “reveals the hassle”; it shows you where you are asking for unreasonable things. If it’s not something our best people would put up with, that means we are losing our potential “new best people” by letting a bad case study stand.
</p>
<p>It also makes sure that everyone in the process knows what kind of thinking goes into producing a good result. Where one of our hiring managers gives someone an “A” grade and recommends we hire them, we want them to be judging a test they are incredibly, intimately familiar with. We want them to be familiar enough with both the case projects themselves and the responses we’ve got back that they can judge quality from experience and data rather than gut feelings.
</p>
<p>We can and do make grading metrics everyone uses, but those metrics are always meant to guide a judgment made from experience, not to replace it.
</p>
			
<h4>Grading Work</h4>
			
			<p>Imagine a manager gets a piece of work back and grades it. This could be a pull request, a support ticket, or any other kind of work; it doesn’t matter for the example. Let’s say he gives it a D, indicating that the person who did the work did a sub-par job. In most companies, we’ve found the next steps focus on correction and remedial action. Most people move directly to fixing the employee.
</p>
			<p>But what if that manager wasn’t right? We don’t just mean if they were wrong in big “this was A grade work and they are discouraging a top performer” ways, even though that happens. What if he was right about the low quality and wrong about why the work failed? What if that means we apply the wrong solutions to the problem, things never get better, and we lose a team member who otherwise would have done good work?
</p>
			<p>This is one of the thousands of places where thinking harder shines. If that manager can’t see the problem (and even if they are a good manager, they are 100% guaranteed to miss things here and there), then a group of managers might see something they don’t. If grading is important, so is grading the graders.
</p>
			
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			
			<p>As stated before, these are just snapshots of a few places we apply <i>Management at Scale</i> meant to serve as examples of how we talk about them. We talk about these concepts in a lot of different ways; for instance, a collection of drill-downs by Bo Lu (our president) is reprinted <a href="https://ambitious-sale-38d.notion.site/Essays-about-managing-at-scale-7061360369c8480997e9794b47e0fd8b">here</a>, and we’ve also created a series of blog posts incorporating some of these concepts on our company substack here.
</p>
			<p>We can talk about this in any way that works for you - whether that’s in an interview, in an article, in video content, or in any other format you might need. Let us know.
